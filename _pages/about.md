Nucleic Acids Research (2022)

<B>Title: SYMBIOSIS: synthetic manipulable biobricks via orthogonal serine integrase systems</B><br/>

In this work, we utilized serine integrases to created a "Keys match Locks" module, such biological part enabled a exponential manipulation of "<i>N</i>" inputs to "<i>2<sup>N</sup>-1</i>" outputs <i>in vivo</i>. Also, we successfully established a serine integrase-based <i>in vitro</i> plasmid assembly approach. This work was published on <B><i>Nucleic Acids Research</i></B> [Link](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/5/2973/6534355), and recommended by "Faculty Opinions (F1000)" as the highest level (three stars) [Link](https://connect.h1.co/article/741722689).

<B>Title: Engineering <i>Escherichia coli</i> to utilize erythritol as sole carbon source</B><br/>

In this work, we successfully engineered <i>E. coli</i> to respond erythritol as a molecule via protein eryD and its characterized 26 bp eryD binding site (eryO). Meanwile, engineered <i>E. coli</i> could also utilize erythritol as sole carbon source. This work was published on <B><i>Advanced Science</i></B> [Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.202207008).

Advanced Materials (2023)
------
<B>Title: Embedding living cells with a mechanically reinforced and functionally programmable hydrogel fiber platform</B><br/>

In this work, we establishes a structure–property–function optimized living hydrogel fiber platform. In details, we reconstructs the genetic circuits of living bacteria to express chromoproteins and fluorescent proteins as two prototypes that enable the coloration of living fibers and sensing water pollutants by monitoring the amount of fluorescent protein expressed. This work was published on <B><i>Advanced Materials</i></B> [Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adma.202305583).
